    \small
    \noindent\textbf{Introduction to number systems and logic}\\
    Overview of the natural numbers, integers, real numbers, rational and irrational numbers, algebraic and transcendental numbers. Brief discussion of complex numbers; statement of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.

    \vspace{5pt}
    \noindent Ideas of axiomatic systems and proof within mathematics; the need for proof; the role of counter-examples in mathematics. Elementary logic; implication and negation; examples of negation of compound statements. Proof by contradiction.\hspace*{\fill}[2]
  
    \vspace{10pt}
    \noindent\textbf{Sets, relations and functions}\\
    Union, intersection and equality of sets. Indicator (characteristic) functions; their use in establishing set identities. Functions; injections, surjections and bijections. Relations, and equivalence relations. Counting the combinations or permutations of a set. The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle.\hspace*{\fill}[4]
  
    \vspace{10pt}
    \noindent\textbf{The integers}\\
    The natural numbers: mathematical induction and the well-ordering principle. Examples, including the Binomial Theorem.\hspace*{\fill}[2]
  
    \vspace{10pt}
    \noindent\textbf{Elementary number theory}\\
    Prime numbers: existence and uniqueness of prime factorisation into primes; highest common factors and least common multiples. Euclid's proof of the infinity of primes. Euclid's algorithm. Solution in integers of $ax+by = c$.
  
    \vspace{5pt}
    \noindent Modular arithmetic (congruences). Units modulo $n$. Chinese Remainder Theorem. Wilson's Theorem; the Fermat-Euler Theorem. Public key cryptography and the RSA algorithm.\hspace*{\fill}[8]
  
    \vspace{10pt}
    \noindent\textbf{The real numbers}\\
    Least upper bounds; simple examples. Least upper bound axiom. Sequences and series; convergence of bounded monotonic sequences. Irrationality of $\sqrt{2}$ and $e$. Decimal expansions. Construction of a transcendental number.\hspace*{\fill} [4]
  
    \vspace{10pt}
    \noindent\textbf{Countability and uncountability}\\
    Definitions of finite, infinite, countable and uncountable sets. A countable union of countable sets is countable. Uncountability of $\R$. Non-existence of a bijection from a set to its power set. Indirect proof of existence of transcendental numbers.\hspace*{\fill}[4]}
