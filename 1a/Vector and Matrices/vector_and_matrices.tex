    \noindent\textbf{Complex numbers}\\
    Review of complex numbers, including complex conjugate, inverse, modulus, argument and Argand diagram. Informal treatment of complex logarithm, $n$-th roots and complex powers. de Moivre's theorem.\hspace*{\fill}[2]

    \noindent\textbf{Vectors}\\
    Review of elementary algebra of vectors in $\R^3$, including scalar product. Brief discussion of vectors in $\R^n$ and $\C^n$; scalar product and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Concepts of linear span, linear independence, subspaces, basis and dimension.
