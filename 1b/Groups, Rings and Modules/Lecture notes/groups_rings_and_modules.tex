    \noindent\textbf{Examples of groups}\\
    Axioms for groups. Examples from geometry: symmetry groups of regular polygons, cube, tetrahedron. Permutations on a set; the symmetric group. Subgroups and homomorphisms. Symmetry groups as subgroups of general permutation groups. The M\"obius group; cross-ratios, preservation of circles, the point at infinity. Conjugation. Fixed points of M\"obius maps and iteration.\hspace*{\fill} [4]

    \vspace{10pt}
    \noindent\textbf{Lagrange's theorem}\\
    Cosets. Lagrange's theorem. Groups of small order (up to order 8). Quaternions. Fermat-Euler theorem from the group-theoretic point of view.\hspace*{\fill} [5]

    \vspace{10pt}
    \noindent\textbf{Group actions}\\
    Group actions; orbits and stabilizers. Orbit-stabilizer theorem. Cayley's theorem (every group is isomorphic to a subgroup of a permutation group). Conjugacy classes. Cauchy's theorem.\hspace*{\fill} [4]

    \vspace{10pt}
    \noindent\textbf{Quotient groups}\\
    Normal subgroups, quotient groups and the isomorphism theorem.\hspace*{\fill} [4]

    \vspace{10pt}
    \noindent
    \textbf{Matrix groups}\\
    The general and special linear groups; relation with the M\"obius group. The orthogonal and special orthogonal groups. Proof (in $\R^3$) that every element of the orthogonal group is the product of reflections and every rotation in $\R^3$ has an axis. Basis change as an example of conjugation.\hspace*{\fill} [3]
    
    \vspace{10pt}
    \noindent\textbf{Permutations}\\
    Permutations, cycles and transpositions. The sign of a permutation. Conjugacy in $S_n$ and in $A_n$. Simple groups; simplicity of $A_5$.\hspace*{\fill} [4]}
